# IMvigor210_mUC
This project will consist of carrying out an analysis of
gene expression in tumor tissue from patients diagnosed
with urothelial carcinoma, with the aim of identifying genes
not only with prognostic impact, but also correlated with
response to immunotherapy. Those final candidate genes will
be validated as prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in
future studies. With the aim of analyzing the weight of
each biomarker in the prognosis of the disease, a various
prognostic models will be optimized. On the other hand,
cellular deconvolution methods will be apply to those groups
of patients defined by our genes of interest in order to better
characterize their tumor microenviroment. The same approach
will be follow for GSEA.

This repository contains all the scripts and data necessary to carry out this analysis.
